differences between tutorial and standard

#### Example 1
* item instead of instance in a collection
* GET description is inaccurate - collection is not always returned
* removed the default version number verbiage 
* screen shots will change with the new version
* changes to special section about return values, especially the put and post. 
* link to developer portal documentation
* remove the last two sections with a discussion of dev portal?

#### Example 2
HATEOAS links - use of self - canonical link to the resource? 

*** Use of the title attribute - discussed in the tutorial but not in the spec - are we still using them

#### Example 3
Need to discuss the whole meta concept





##### example 4 
dot notation









standard update:
only one identifier type per top level resource
