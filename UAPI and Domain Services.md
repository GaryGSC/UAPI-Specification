### URLs
#### Namespaces
The namespace designated for Domain APIs is:

```
https://api.byu.edu/domains/{domain_name}
```

The *domain_name* portion of the Domain API namespace is determined by the domain team. For example, if a domain team had chosen the domain_name "identity," its namespace would be:

```
https://api.byu.edu/domains/identity
```
