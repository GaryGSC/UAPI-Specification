# Test-driving the Persons API With Postman

The Persons API (V2) is a good example of an API that conforms to the University API (UAPI) Specification. The Persons API provides access to a large amount of data if the user knows how to operate it correctly. It is also a good model for how to operate all UAPI conformant APIs.

We will use Postman - an interactive REST client - to explore some of what the Persons API can do. 

## API Manager Setup

- Access the [API Manager Store](https://api.byu.edu/store), log in, and search for Persons V2
- Add a new application, generate keys - copy keys for later use. 
- Find persons 
- Add a subscription to that application


## Postman Setup

- Download [Postman](https://postman.com) as either a browser extension or a native application - your choice.
- install the environment for the workspace
- update environment with client-id, client-secret, username, and password

- Install Persons collection
